## ‚ú® Why Nuvom?

Nuvom is a developer-first job execution engine that helps you queue, execute, and persist background tasks‚Äîwithout needing Redis, Celery, or any external services. Designed to be fully **Windows-compatible**, Nuvom favors **simplicity**, **smart defaults**, and **pluggable architecture** over complexity and vendor lock-in.

Key philosophies:

* ü™ü **Runs on Windows** (no Linux-only assumptions)
* üîå **Plugin-first**: easily extend queues, backends, task loaders
* ‚öôÔ∏è **No Redis**, **no brokers**, and **no infrastructure**
* üìú **AST-powered static task discovery** (no imports required)
* üìÇ **Manifest caching** for blazing-fast CLI performance

## üß† Core Concepts

| Concept    | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `@task`    | Decorator to register an executable function      |
| Job        | A serialized instance of a task to be executed    |
| Worker     | Thread that pulls and runs jobs from a queue      |
| Dispatcher | Orchestrates job dispatching and retries          |
| Backend    | Stores job results or errors                      |
| Registry   | Maps task names to callables and metadata         |
| Discovery  | Uses AST parsing to auto-discover all tasks       |
| CLI        | Full-featured developer CLI for control & insight |
| Plugins    | Dynamically loaded components to extend Nuvom     |

---

## üì¶ Installation

> Nuvom is currently in active development. Until v1.0, install locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nahom-zewdu/Nuvom
cd Nuvom
pip install -e .
```

### üîß Dependencies

* `rich`
* `typer`
* `pydantic-settings`
* `msgpack`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quickstart

### 1. Define a Task

```python
# tasks.py
from nuvom.task import task

@task(retries=2, retry_delay_secs=5, timeout_secs=3, store_result=True)
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

### 2. Queue a Job

```python
from tasks import add

job = add.delay(5, 7)
print(job.id)
```

### 3. Start the Worker Pool

```bash
nuvom runworker
```

### 4. Check Job Result

```bash
nuvom inspect job <job_id>
```

### 5. Check Result of Multiple Jobs

```bash
nuvom history recent --limit 10 --status SUCCESS
```

### 6. Retry a failed job (manual)

```python
from nuvom.sdk import retry_job
retry_job("<job_id>")
```

## ‚è± Retry Delay + Timeout Policy

Nuvom v0.8 introduces full support for job retries and timeout policies with fine-grained control:

| Field             | Purpose                                               |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `timeout_policy`  | Timeout-policy support to Job for runtime control on timeout behavior|
| `timeout_secs`    | Maximum time in seconds a job is allowed to run     |
| `retries`         | How many times to retry a job after failure          |
| `retry_delay_secs`| Wait time (in seconds) before retrying a failed job  |

If a job fails and `retries > 0`, depending on the timeout-policy it will be retried automatically after the specified delay. All retry attempts and tracebacks are recorded in metadata.

```python
@task(retries=2, timeout_policy='retry', retry_delay_secs=5, timeout_secs=3)
def unstable():
    raise RuntimeError("Oops")

enqueue(Job("unstable"))
```

## üîß Configuration

Nuvom loads settings from `.env` via `pydantic-settings`.

### Example `.env`

```env
NUVOM_ENVIRONMENT=dev|prod|test
NUVOM_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR|
NUVOM_RESULT_BACKEND=file|memory
NUVOM_QUEUE_BACKEND=file|memory
NUVOM_SERIALIZATION_BACKEND=msgpack
NUVOM_MAX_WORKERS=4
NUVOM_BATCH_SIZE=10
NUVOM_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECS=30
NUVOM_MANIFEST_PATH=.nuvom/manifest.json
NUVOM_TIMEOUT_POLICY=fail|retry|ignore
NUVOM_PROMETHEUS_PORT=9160
```

---

### Plugin Configuration via `.nuvom_plugins.toml`

To enable Prometheus metrics, add the plugin to `.nuvom_plugins.toml`:

```toml
[plugins]
prometheus = ["nuvom.plugins.monitoring.prometheus:PrometheusPlugin"]
```

 You can override the default exporter port (defaults to 9150) in your .env

---

## üìö Internals

### Task Discovery

* Parses files with AST to find `@task` decorators
* Skips `.nuvomignore` and filtered paths
* Writes results to `.nuvom/manifest.json`
* Loaded during runtime or via `nuvom discover tasks`

### Worker Execution

* Multi-threaded workers pull jobs in batches
* Jobs are executed with timeouts and retries
* Lifecycle hooks are respected: `before_job`, `after_job`, `on_error`
* On graceful shutdown, all active workers cleanly stop, flush logs, and exit safely
* Plugin-based workers also receive lifecycle events for teardown

### Backends

* Memory and file-based backends
* Fully pluggable via interface (`BaseJobQueue`, `BaseResultBackend`)
* Plugins can register new queue or result backends via `.nuvom_plugins.toml`
* SQLite backend uses on-disk persistence with a compact schema and fast queries

## üìà Prometheus Monitoring Plugin

Nuvom comes with a built-in Prometheus plugin to expose live worker and queue metrics for observability and alerting.

### Metrics Exposed

| Metric Name           | Description                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `nuvom_worker_count`  | Number of active worker threads      |
| `nuvom_inflight_jobs` | Number of jobs currently executing   |
| `nuvom_queue_size`    | Current number of jobs in the queue  |

### How it Works

Once enabled, the Prometheus plugin runs a lightweight HTTP server exposing metrics at:

`http://localhost:<port>/metrics`

It scrapes runtime data from the dispatcher via a live `metrics_provider` hook.

### Debug Page

You can also visit:
`http://localhost:<port>/`

to see a human-friendly info page confirming the exporter is running.

## üõ† Extending Nuvom

Example: Registering a custom result backend plugin

```python
from nuvom.plugins.contracts import Plugin

class MyResultBackend:
    def set_result(...): ...
    def get_result(...): ...
    def set_error(...): ...
    def get_error(...): ...

class MyPlugin(Plugin):
    api_version = "<version>"
    name = "my_plugin"
    provides = ["result_backend"]

    def start(self, settings):
        from nuvom.plugins.registry import register_result_backend
        register_result_backend("my_backend", MyResultBackend)

    def stop(self): pass
```

Add it to `.nuvom_plugins.toml`:

```toml
[plugins]
result_backend = ["my_plugin:MyPlugin"]
```
